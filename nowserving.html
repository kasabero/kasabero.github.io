[<a id="yfs">YFS</a>] <b>Young Franken Stein Barleywine</b> 
<br/>
<i>12% ABV</i>
<p>
<i>Frankie</i> is Kasabero's version of an American-style Barleywine
modeled after AleSmith's Old Numbskull. Clocking in at 12% ABV, the
2015 version of this beer got two doses of yeast to guarantee full
attenuation. The beer was then aged in a barrel that originally housed
Fluxuate Whiskey by Seven Stills of SF. The barrel imparted
significant boozy character and a nice depth that was rounded out with
another healthy dose of hops added after barrel aging. He's tasty now,
but we look forward to trying him again in a few months!

[<a id="kal">KAL</a>] <b>Kal's Booty Barrel Aged Belgian Quad</b> -
Inspired by some of our favorite Lost Abbey brews, Kal was designed as
the first resident of our 10-gallon Chocasmoke Whiskey barrel from
Seven Stills of SF.

[<a id="skal">KALS</a>] <b>Kal's Booty Barrel Aged Belgian Quad with
Strawberry</b> - After barrel aging our basic <a href="#kal">Kal</a>,
three gallons were extracted and aged on four pounds of frozen
strawberries. Refreshing and very drinkable, you'd never know this was
a 12% beer!

[<a id="rkal">KALR</a>] <b>Kal's Booty Barrel Aged Belgian Quad with
Raisins</b> - When we conceived of Kal, we imagined a sticky sweet and
sippable brew. A stark contrast to <a href="#skal">Strawberry Kal</a>,
Raisin Kal has a deeper character gained from aging his final two
weeks on raisins instead of strawberries. Save for enjoyment on a cool
winter night!

[<a id="fya">FYA</a>] <b>First Year American White House Honey Ale</b>
- FYA is Kasabero's version of the White House Honey Ale
recipe. Brewed with Macadamia Nut Blossom honey straight from Maui,
this is a nice summer brew. We enjoyed it paired with Indian food.

[<a id="sh">SH</a>] <b>SHSMaSH</b> - SHSMaSH is our Southern
Hemisphere Single Malt Single Hop beer. This hoppy extra pale ale uses
only Patagonia Extra Pale Malt from Chile and Motueka hops from New
Zealand. Fermented with Giga Yeast Vermont IPA yeast, this brew got
four doses of hops, first wort, five minute, flame out, and dry
hop. A crisp and flavorful beer!
