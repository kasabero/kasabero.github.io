[<a id="yfs">YFS</a>] - <b>Young Franken Stein Barleywine</b> "Frankie" is Kasabero's version of an American-style Barleywine modeled after AleSmith's Old Numbskull. Clocking in at 12% ABV, the 2015 version of this beer got two doses of yeast to guarantee full attenuation. The beer was then aged in a barrel that originally housed <a href="http://www.sevenstillsofsf.com/">Fluxuate Whiskey by Seven Stills</a>. The barrel imparted significant boozy character, and a nice depth that was rounded out with another healthy dose of hops added after barrel aging. He's tasty now, but we look forward to trying him again in a few months!
