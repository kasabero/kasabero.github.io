[<a id="yfs">YFS</a>] <b>Young Franken Stein</b> 
<br/>
<i>Barrel Aged American-style Barleywine, 12.5% ABV</i>
<br/>
<i>Kasabero Batch 29</i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
<i>Frankie</i> is Kasabero's version of an American-style Barleywine
modeled after AleSmith's Old Numbskull. Clocking in at 12.5% ABV, the
2015 version of this beer got two doses of yeast to guarantee full
attenuation. The beer was then aged in a barrel that originally housed
Fluxuate Whiskey by Seven Stills of SF. The barrel imparted
significant boozy character and a nice depth that was rounded out with
another healthy dose of hops added after barrel aging. He's tasty now,
but we look forward to trying him again in a few months!

[<a id="kal">KAL</a>] <b>Kal's Booty</b> 
<br/>
<i>Barrel Aged Belgian Quad, approximately 9% ABV</i>
<br/>
<i>Kasabero Batches 31 and 32</i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
Inspired by some of our favorite Lost Abbey brews, Kal was designed as
the first resident of our 10-gallon Chocasmoke Whiskey barrel from
Seven Stills of SF. We combined two five-gallon batches of an Avery The Reverend clone and allowed the flavors to meld for five weeks in the barrel. The resulting beer has a prominent whiskey flavor that balances nicely with the fruity esters and malt profile of the Belgian style.

[<a id="skal">SKAL</a>] <b>Kal's Booty - Strawberry</b> 
<br/>
<i>Barrel Aged Belgian Quad with Strawberry, approximately 9% ABV</i>
<br/>
<i>Kasabero Batches 31 and 32</i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
After barrel aging our basic <a href="#kal">Kal</a>, three gallons
were extracted and aged on four pounds of frozen
strawberries. Refreshing and very drinkable, you'd never know this was
a 9% beer!

[<a id="rkal">RKAL</a>] <b>Kal's Booty - Raisin</b> 
<br/>
<i>Barrel Aged Belgian Quad with Raisins, approximately 9% ABV</i>
<br/>
<i>Kasabero Batches 31 and 32</i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
When we conceived of Kal, we imagined a sticky sweet and sippable
brew. A stark contrast to <a href="#skal">Strawberry Kal</a>, Raisin
Kal has a deeper character gained from aging his final two weeks on
raisins instead of strawberries. Save for enjoyment on a cool winter
night!

[<a id="sh">SH</a>] <b>SHSMaSH</b> 
<br/>
<i>Single Malt Single Hop, 4.7% ABV</i>
<br/>
<i>Kasabero Batch 35</i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
SHSMaSH is our Southern Hemisphere Single Malt Single Hop beer. This
hoppy blond uses only Patagonia Extra Pale Malt from Chile
and Motueka hops from New Zealand. Fermented with Giga Yeast Vermont
IPA yeast, this brew got four doses of hops, first wort, five minute,
flame out, and dry hop. A crisp and flavorful beer!

[<a id="fya">FYA</a>] <b>First Year American</b>
<br/>
<i>White House Honey Ale, 5.3% ABV</i>
<br/>
<i>Kasabero Batch 36</i>
<br/><br/>
<p>
FYA is Kasabero's version of the White House Honey Ale recipe. Brewed
with Macadamia Nut Blossom honey straight from Maui, this is a nice
summer brew. We enjoy it paired with Indian food.
